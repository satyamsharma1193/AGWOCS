Hi. This is the matlab code for AGWOCS hybrid metaheuristic. Just download the file and browse it from the matlab directory. After that run the main.m file.
The research paper for AGWOCS algorithm:
A Novel Hybrid Metaheuristic Based on Augmented Grey Wolf Optimizer and Cuckoo Search for Global Optimization (ISCCC 2021), India, 2021, pp.376-381, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSCCC51823.2021.9478142
